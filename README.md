FeedTheStray is a Flutter application developed to tackle the hardships that are faced by the stray dogs amidst the pandameic. Most countries are in some form of lockdown, and street dogs are in deep trouble - they depend on volunteers and animal lovers to feed them. 

Thousands of stray cats and dogs in India depend on food and waste from markets, restaurants and grocery shops. But with coronavirus sending people into isolation and public establishments shutting down, strays are having a hard time finding food. 

Many who fed animals regularly stopped due to the coronavirus scare
